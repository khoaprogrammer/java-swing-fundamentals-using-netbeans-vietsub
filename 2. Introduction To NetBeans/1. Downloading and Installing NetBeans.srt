00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this module, we're going to download and install NetBeans, then we'll explore some of its features and

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
structure, and after we're going to build an actual application, so you'll have a really good idea of what

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
NetBeans and Swing can do by the end of this module.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First, we're going to go open a browser. We'll go to netbeans.org.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And as you see on the home page, we'll click the Learn More button, and under Documentation click on the link

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
for Release Notes and then on System Requirements. You might want to look this over to see if their

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
requirements match your machine. Also, a little further down here we see Required Software.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, in the last module we installed the JRE, the Java Runtime Environment, but NetBeans actually requires

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the Java Development Kit that contains the additional developer tools for compiling and debugging.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're going to need this. If you already have it installed, make sure that you have JDK 7u21.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's the release that's necessary to run applications in NetBeans.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So let's go back to the home page here, and we'll click on the Download button.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We'll have several choices here. If you scroll down in the text below, it explains that you can download the

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
JDK separately, standalone, or in a bundle with NetBeans. If you already have the JDK installed on your machine,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you have two choices above. You can get the Java SE version or the Java EE version.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you're a serious Java programmer and you might require in future the server like GlassFish or Apache Tomcat,

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
download the Java EE version. Otherwise, you can just download the Java SE version.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What we're going to do though is download the latest JDK with NetBeans IDE in a bundle, so click that link.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You'll have to accept the license agreement. If you want to read that, go right ahead.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Choose the proper version for your machine. If you have Windows, the x86 is actually the 32-bit version.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Windows x64 is the 64-bit version. I'm going to click on the x86 version myself, and it begins the download.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can pause here. I'm going to go get a cup of coffee while you finish the download.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let me know when you're done.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay great, we've completed the download. Now let's go over to the Downloads page on your browser.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You'll see the exe file in my case. We'll click on that. It will come up and ask us if we want to continue

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
with the program installation, Yes, and it will bring up the installer.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is going to take you a few minutes, so I'm going to get another pot of coffee, and we'll move on.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
In the next module, we'll open up NetBeans and explore what it can do.
