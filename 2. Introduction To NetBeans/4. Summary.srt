00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this module, you've learned about the NetBeans IDE and the Java Development Kit that it requires.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You've learned about the Palette, Properties, Design, and Inspector panes of NetBeans.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You've seen the advantage of NetBeans creating automatically generated code, such as the initComponents

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
method that sets up the window layout and window closing code automatically.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You have been introduced to Swing's labels, text fields, and buttons.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You've learned about event listeners and how to use the actionPerformed method for a button.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You've learned about how to retrieve text from a text field and parse it to a number, and you've learned to set

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
text in a label. We've even introduced a very useful Java class called DecimalFormat.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And you've been introduced to just one of Swing's dialog windows using the JOptionPane.showMessageDialog method.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now let's learn more about each of Swing's components.
