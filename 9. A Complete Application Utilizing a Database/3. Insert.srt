1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
When the user is entering a new record, it doesn't really make much sense for the Update and Delete buttons

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to be visible. No problem. As you may recall, we used two different constructors to create the GridBagGUI window.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first one here is the default and is called when we want to insert a record, so here we can type

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:39,000
updateButton.setVisible false and deleteButton.setVisible false.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just to ensure we cover all our bases, let's play it safe and make sure that the Insert button is visible,

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so we type insertButton.setVisible true. Now this next constructor is called for update and delete operations.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't want the Insert button and we do want the Update and Delete buttons, so let's paste the code and change

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:19,000
insert to false, update and delete to true. One last thing is necessary to make our Insert button work,

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so right-click and select Action, actionPerformed. First, we'll need to create an instance of the Contacts

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
object, then assign the text fields from the form to its properties.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So Contacts c = new Contacts. C.setFirstname firstNameField.getText.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then c.setLastname = lastNameField.getText, and c.setStreet streetField.getText, and lastly,

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:41,000
c.setCity = cityField.getText. Now to store our object in the database, we just create an instance of DBManager,

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:55,000
DBManager dbm = new DBManager and call its Insert method passing our Contacts object as a parameter,

15
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
dbm.insert c, then clean up the DBManager with the Close method.

16
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then of course the form window should close when we're done, so we can do that with setVisible false and dispose.

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now before we run it, we should start the DB server and connect to the database, so click the Services tab,

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
right-click Java Database, and select Start Server, then click the connection and select Connect.

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now let's run the application. Click on the Add Contact button and our form appears.

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Only the Insert button is visible. Type in some data, first name, last name, street, and city, then click Insert.

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The form window closes and oh, we have a problem here. The contacts table isn't updating with the new record.

22
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Although there are solutions to forcing the table to refresh with the new data, none of them are actually very

23
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
easy to implement. In our case here, there is one simple work-around.

24
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
When the Add Contact button is clicked and the GridBagGUI form is generated, we can close the contacts table

25
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
window temporarily. Then when the user clicks the Insert button, we can regenerate the ContactsTableGUI and

26
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it will appear with the new data. So first, let's move over to the ContactsTableGUI,

27
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
addContactButtonActionPerformed method, and add code to close that window.

28
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We can just type setVisible false and dispose. Now back to the GridBagGUI's insertButtonActionPerformed

29
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:29,000
method and add new ContactTableGUI.setVisible true. Now this is not an ideal way of dealing with this issue,

30
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but it does work for our purposes without getting overly complex.

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay, let's run it once again. (Running) Click Add Contact and the contacts table closes.

32
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Enter first name, last name, street, and city, click Insert, and the contacts table opens again showing our new data.

33
00:06:04,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Next, we will cover update and delete.
