00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well now you have built an application that interacts with the database.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Using the GUI windows we built previously, you learned to insert, update, and delete records in a database table.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Although we had to actually write some code to do so, you learned some valuable techniques.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As a bonus,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you had an introduction to the Java Persistence API and learned how that makes the developer's job somewhat

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
easier using its EntityManager methods.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You learned about annotations and how to use them to create a unique primary key generator.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You learned how to set the visibility of buttons in a window to suit the application's needs.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You learned how to create and close windows easily. You learned how to

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
match text fields in a form to a Java entity bean, then use that object with the EntityManager.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You learned how to use the ListSelectionListener interface to listen for mouse events on a JTable,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
then pass that row's data to a GUI window's text fields.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There are many different ways to code to interact with a database.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:59:00,000
How would you go about it? At least now, you have a strong foundation of how to build the GUI interface.
