00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, let's fix the GUI to call our database code. To make life a little easier, let's first rename the four

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
text fields we'll be using, First Name, Last Name, Street, and City.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the interest of time, we are not going to include the rest of the fields.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So right-click the First Name text field, and select Change Variable Name, and call it firstNameField.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then right-click the Last Name field, and call it lastNameField, then right-click the Street field,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
call it streetField, and right-click the City field, and call it cityField.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This GUI, GridBagGUI it's called, will pop up whenever we want the user to either insert, update, or delete a record.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The main window of our application is still a contacts table GUI, the one displaying the table data,

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so we'll want to change the JFrame property of the GridBagGUI defaultCloseOperation property to DISPOSE

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
just as we did earlier when we created the About window. Do you remember that?

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So now, when this window closes, it will not exit the entire application altogether.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, one last thing. These three buttons should now be called Insert, Update, and Delete, so we'll need to

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
rename them and let's change the variable names while we're at it.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right-click, Edit Text, type Insert. Then right-click, Change Variable Name to insertButton.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right-click, Edit Text, and type Update. Right-click, Change Variable Name to updateButton.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right-click, Edit Text, call it Delete. Right-click it, change its name to deleteButton.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For now, let's go over to the ContactsTableGUI and add what we need there.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's stretch out the JFrame to make room for a new button. Drag a button down here, change its text to Add Contact,

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and change its variable name to addContactButton. Now let's right-click the button and create an

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
actionPerformed event for it. Here is where we can create the GridBagGUI form, so the user can enter the new data.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So as we did before for the About GUI in a previous module, we type new GridBagGUI.setVisible true.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now let's try it. The application starts up with the contacts table as the default, click the Add Contact

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
button, and the GridBagGUI form appears. Next, we'll add our insert code.
