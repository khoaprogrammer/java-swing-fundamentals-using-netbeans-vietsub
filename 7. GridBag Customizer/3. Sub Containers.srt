00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You may have noticed a few weird things as we stretched the application previously.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The Browse buttons didn't stay put, and the buttons on the bottom here didn't stay together either.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can fix that by creating something called Sub Containers. So first, let's select the Browse and Street

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
text field, right-click, and select Enclose in Container. This actually encloses them in a JPanel.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's do the same for City and Browse and also again for the buttons along the bottom here.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now when we stretch the application, things stay where they should.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now we can't select these buttons any longer. Instead, the JPanel is selected.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No problem. Now all we have to do is right-click and select Design This Container.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sub Container opens. Let's add another button. Right-click, Insert Column After, right-click the new cell

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Add Component Button. Now to return to the parent container, all we have to do is right-click and select

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Design Parent Container. Now we haven't changed the names of these buttons yet, so let's return to the Design

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:02:00,000
area and do so. Right-click, Edit Text, and call this one OK. The next one, Cancel, and the last one, Help.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now let's go back to the customizer (Working) and then design the button container.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's select all three buttons and adjust the insets a bit. (Working)

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's good. Now back to the parent container and preview it. Now everything holds together much better.
