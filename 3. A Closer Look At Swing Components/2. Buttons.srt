00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's probably obvious now that buttons contain the same properties we've already discussed such as background,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
foreground, font, icons, pneumonics, borders, and so on. Let's put a button here and change the name of it.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll call this on Submit. Previously, we discussed how to add the ActionPerformed method to a button,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so we're not going to do that again. For now, let's move on and add toggle buttons.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Unlike regular buttons, toggle buttons maintain two different states basically, selected and deselected.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's call this one Agree. (Working) As we run the application, we can see the toggle button's behavior

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:25,000
selected and deselected. (Working) Let's add a second toggle button and call it Disagree. (Working)

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We can tie these two toggle buttons together using something called a Button Group.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As we drag the button group into the design area, it is invisible, but, as you can see, it appears in the

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:02:02,000
inspector window over here. Let's change its variable name to toggleButtonGroup. (Typing)

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now, if we select the Agree button, you can see that our toggleButtonGroup appears in its property for

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:21,000
buttonGroup, and we can assign this button to that group. Let's also do the same for the Disagree button. (Working)

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now when we run the application, selecting one deselects the other.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In this case, it probably makes more sense to have the Agree button initially selected.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We can set that in the Agree button's properties. Now if we run it again, you can see Agree is selected from the start.

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now let's check out radio buttons. Let's add three of them (Working) and call them Single, Married,

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and Divorced/Widowed. Radio buttons are almost always in a button group.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's create another group and call it radioButtonGroup. Now we can select all three radio buttons and assign

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:07,000
them to our group. Let's run it and check it out. You could choose to have one initially selected or not.

20
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, lastly let's explore check boxes. These are not usually placed in button groups as the user is allowed

21
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:36,000
most of the time to check more than one. Let's call this one I agree to the terms, and this one Please send

22
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:57,000
me a newsletter. (Typing) Let's give the application a little extra space and run it.

23
00:04:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
As you can see, the check boxes act as expected. Next, we'll explore lists and combo boxes.
