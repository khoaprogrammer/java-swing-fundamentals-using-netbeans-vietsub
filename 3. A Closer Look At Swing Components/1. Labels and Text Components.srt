00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this module, we're going to take a closer look at Swing components from labels to text fields and text

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
areas, buttons, lists, and combo boxes, spinners, sliders, progress bars, tables, and trees.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's just get right to it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Open up NetBeans. First we'll need to start a new project, Java, Java Application.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Click Next. We'll call it SwingComponentProject. If the Create Main Class checkbox is checked,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
make sure that it's unchecked because we don't need to do that. Click Finish.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, so now we'll need to create our JForm, so right-click on the project, click New and JFrame From.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We'll call it SwingComponentGUI. We'll give the package name com.Pluralsight and click Finish.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, we have our JFrame form. Let's add several labels and text boxes for the example I want to show you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So first we'll add a label here, Label1, Label2, and Label3. Three text boxes, text fields, excuse me. (Working)

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, let's give these names so that they make sense later. For our first field, we'll call it First Name,

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the next one Middle Name, and next Last Name. (Typing) Let's line up these fields just a little bit,

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
make it look better. Now let's change the variable names for these so they make more sense programmatically later on.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's call the first one firstNameLabel, change the variable name to middleNameLabel, and, you guessed it,

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:12,000
lastNameLabel. Our text fields, firstNameField, middleNameField, and lastNameField.

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's select all of the text fields, and we'll set the number of columns within the box to 12.

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This will hold them at that size. So, as you saw before, when we get rid of the text in the field,

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
they will not shrink. They will maintain the 12-column size. That's their preferred size.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So we'll lose all the text in the fields. Now, an interesting trick with labels is you can use something called

20
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
a pneumonic, so we'll give the first one a pneumonical F, the next one M, and the last one L.

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This will allow us to use keyboard commands to give focus to the text fields.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So for first name we need to put the label for firstNameField, the label for middleNameField for the next one,

23
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and the label for lastNameField for the last one. This will make it focus on the text field when we hit Alt+F,

24
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alt+M, or Alt+L. Let's run it, and we'll show you. As usual, you have to OK that this is the main class.

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Notice that the first characters of each label are underlined indicating that they have a keyboard command

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
associated with them. If I type in Alt+L, that text field gains focus.

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Alt+M and Alt+F, it works just fine. It's a nice little trick. Okay, let's have a look at some of the properties

28
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:07,000
of text fields. You can add an icon, an image if you wish. Let's import it to the project so it's part of it. (Working)

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So you can have images and text co-existing within a label. You can also line up the text on either side of

30
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the label using the horizontalTextPosition property. You can have different spacing by setting the iconTextGap.

31
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For now, let's just reset that back to default. Now also you can have borders with a label if you wish,

32
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that's Bevel Border here, different ones you can experiment with.

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's try the Line Border, see what that looks like. You can play around all you want, but let's set this

34
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
back to default. Now with a text field, you can set the background to any color you wish if you feel that's

35
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
something you want to do. A text field can be editable. Usually that's set programmatically, but there is a

36
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
checkbox here to gray out the fields so the user can't input anything.

37
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Foreground color would actually give the text a specific color.

38
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You can set the alignment of the text within the field. You can set tooltips for a field, so let's say Help Me.

39
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And let's run it, and we'll show you what the tooltip looks like.

40
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There you go. Also, you can set any sort of font and size in bold or whatever.

41
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And you can set borders, of course, on text fields as well. (Working)

42
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's add another label here, and we'll call this one Password.

43
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's change the variable name to passwordLabel. There's a special kind of text field called a Password

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Field, and of course it comes up with the asterisks to hide what was typed.

45
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's set its columns for 12 as well, let's clear out the text in the field, and let's run it.

46
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
As you can see, anything typed in this field shows up with the standard asterisks to hide the text.

47
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Now let's have a look at a text area. Text areas allow the user to type in a large amount of text.

48
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You'll see down here on the left it's automatically enclosed in a JScroll pane.

49
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So if text is typed beyond the limits of the box area, scroll bars will appear.

50
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's call it the bioTextArea. So our user can enter a bio. Let's put a label in here as well, call it bio,

51
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:06,000
bioLabel, and the name Bio. So let's run this and see what a text area looks like.

52
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's type some text in. As you can see, there's no line wrapping.

53
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Scroll bars appear automatically, but we would probably like to use the line wrap feature, which is one of

54
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the properties of a text area, so we check that. Let's run it again. (Typing)

55
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Now as we type, you'll see that it does line wrap. But look, it wraps right in the middle of a word.

56
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We can fix that as well. So there's another property called wrapStyleWord, which will prevent that from happening.

57
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's run it one last time. (Typing) That looks a lot better. (Typing)

58
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Now if I keep on typing and fill up this whole area with text, you'll see the scroll bars automatically

59
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:39,000
appear, and it will not increase the size of the text area I have allowed here. (Working)

60
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You could also set the fonts for a text area, of course the same old stuff.

61
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You can set the color of the background if you wish. You can set the color of the foreground for the fonts.

62
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can set borders. Most components have these options. Now there's one final type of text field I want to

63
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:21,000
show you, so let's add another label and call it phoneLabel. (Typing)

64
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's change its text to Phone. Then we'll add a FormattedTextField.

65
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's make it 12 columns just like the others, clear out its text.

66
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The interesting thing about a formatted field is this property formatterFactory.

67
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This allows you to constrain text to specific formats, such as numbers, dates, times, percentage, currency,

68
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
or any specific pattern you want. Since this is a phone number, we'll use the custom mask.

69
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's already close to what we want, but we'll have to add an area code as well.

70
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now let's run it. Text entered here will automatically conform to the phone number format we wish.

71
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So we've covered the basics of labels and text fields. Next, we'll learn about the various types of buttons,

72
00:12:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
including toggle buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes. Now let's move on and explore buttons.
