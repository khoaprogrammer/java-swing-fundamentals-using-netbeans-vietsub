00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's time to explore tables and trees. We won't have enough space to add these to our current form,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so let's create a new project. First, let's close out this window.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then, as we've done before, go to File, New Project, Java Application.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's call it TableTreeProject. Make sure Create Main Class is deselected.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then right-click on the project, New, JFrame Form. Let's call it TableTreeGUI and package name com.Pluralsight.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:01,000
(Working) Okay, now we can make the frame large enough for our examples.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So first, let's drag a table onto the form. The table's default size is four columns and four rows.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We'll just stick with that for now. Notice that the table is also wrapped in a scroll pane as you can see in

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the inspector pane. Now, if we click on model, we can edit the names and types of the columns.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's call the first one First Name, and we'll make it a string, the next one Last Name, also a string,

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:02,000
then Age, and let's make that an integer. And lastly, let's call this Opt In and make it a Boolean.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We have option here of making the table cells editable by the user or not inserting, deleting, or moving columns

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and changing the row and column count. If we click on the Default Values tab, we can enter in default values

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
in the table cells. Of course it's quite likely that if you are including a table in a form you're going to

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,000
be displaying data from a database. In a later module, we will be binding data to a table.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
For now, we are going to just explore the basics and keep it simple.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We also have options here for inserting, deleting, and moving columns and rows.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, if we run this, (Working) you can see our table appears as you would expect.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The table cells are editable by the user. (Working) I can also edit the model by right-clicking and selecting

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Table Contents. Here I can deselect the editable property. I can change table cell data, or edit the column's

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:08,000
names and types. (Working) Let's have a look at the tree. (Working)

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's resize it a bit. The default comes loaded with sample data.

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We'll just use that for our example. The tree is also wrapped in a scroll pane.

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's run it and see what it does. You can expand each of the nodes and select one or multiple selections.

25
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's take a look at the model for a moment. You can set the nodes and sub-nodes over here on the left.

26
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The top level has no space before the text. The next sublevel has one space, and the next sublevel has two spaces.

27
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can also bind data to a tree. Tables and trees are very powerful GUI components and can also be a little

28
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
bit more complex. There are events associated with both, but we will not dive into that code at this time.

29
00:05:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
As I mentioned, in an upcoming module we will bind a database to a table for a more real world example.
