00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You've learned quite a lot about Swing's main components. You now have enough knowledge to build GUI

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
interfaces with confidence. You now know how to use labels, text components, buttons, lists, combo boxes,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
spinners, sliders, progress bars, tables, and trees. You know how to set their common properties,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and you have learned how to write code within the generated event methods to make use of user input for

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
buttons using the ActionPerformed method, for lists using the ValueChanged method, for combo boxes using

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the ActionPerfomed method, for spinners and sliders using the StateChanged method, and how to set inputs to

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
a progress bar using the setValue method.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You've learned how to represent basic data using tables and tress as well.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
There's still a lot more to come. Next, we'll have a look at Swing containers.
