1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You have learned some very interesting and powerful techniques as we've covered the basics of

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
JOptionPanes,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
File Choosers,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and Color Choosers, all of which are very useful to almost any application.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
First, you learned about the four elements of JOptionPanes: message, icon, data input, and buttons.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then you learned about the three formats of JOptionPanes using versions of the three methods

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
showMessageDialog,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
showOptionDialog,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and showInputDialog. You learned about

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the various message types available in JOptionPanes, as well as the option types.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You also learned how to implement a File

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Chooser, how to set its properties to point to specific directories, and you were introduced to code that

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
opens a file and displays it within a text area. You were introduced to code to filter specific

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
file types within a File Chooser as well. You also learned

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
of the JColorChooser component and the showDialog method used to create it.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You learned how to use the color object it returns to change the color of almost any component within your application.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Next, you'll learn how to customize the layout of an application more specifically using a tool call the

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
GridBag Customizer that comes in NetBeans.
