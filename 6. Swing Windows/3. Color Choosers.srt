00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You may want to offer users the ability to choose color of components or

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
fonts within an application. Swing provides the JColorChooser component for this purpose.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The Color Chooser can be created anywhere within an application.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Once again, NetBeans provides a Color Chooser component you can simply drag into the design area or add from

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
palette to the Other Components item in the inspector, such as we did with the File Chooser.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But as with JOptionPanes, the easiest way to create a Color Chooser is with code.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Only one line of code is necessary. Let's use our FileChooserProject to demonstrate.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:03,000
First, let's add another menu item to the File menu and call it Set Background.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Double-click to create its ActionPerformed method. Let's type JColorChooser.showDialog.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And, as you can see, there is only one option here, and a method with three simple parameters.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The first is the parent component, the same as we used in JOptionPane, next a title for the chooser window,

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and last the initial color to be selected. So let's make the parent component null, add a title,

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please choose a color, and the initial color is a constant of the color object, Color.white.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now this method returns a color object, so let's add that and call it color.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now we can use that color result to set the background of our text area.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Just type textArea.setBackground(color). And that's it. Let's run the application and check it out. (Running)

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Select the menu item Set Background, and the Color Chooser appears.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now there are five different panels here with different ways to select colors.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If that is not enough for you, then color choosers can be customized for your specific needs as well.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If we choose a color and click OK, the text area's background is set to that color.

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That was pretty easy. How would you use a Color Chooser in an application?
