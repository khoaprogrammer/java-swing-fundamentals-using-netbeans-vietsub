00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're about to learn something very useful. We're going to build a File Chooser and open a file.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's get right into it, and I'll show you how it's done. I think it's best if we start a new project for this example.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's choose New Project, Java Application, call it FileChooserProject, deselect Create Main Class,

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:55,000
then right-click the project and select New JFrame Form, call the class FileChooserGUI, and the package com.Pluralsight.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's make the application larger and add a JMenuBar. We won't need the second menu, so right-click it and Delete.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now right-click File and Add From Palette, Menu Item. Right-click to Edit Text, and change it to Open.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Might as well double-click the shortcut and make it Ctrl+O. Let's change the variable name to Open.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
While we're at it, let's create one more for exit, so right-click File, Add From Palette, Menu Item.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Right-click Edit Text to exit. Double-click the shortcut, and make it Ctrl+Q.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Change the variable name to Exit, as well. We've done this before, so you should be an expert by now.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Double-click the Exit menu item, and it creates the ExitActionPerformed method, and we'll type in system.exit(0)

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:39,000
as we've done before. Before we move on to the File Chooser, let's also add a text area to our application.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's stretch it to the max and change its variable name to textArea.

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now here's a great trick. It's time to add the File Chooser, but we don't want to just drag it into the design area.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We want to create it with code from our open menu item. So here we can right-click the Other Components item

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
in the inspector and select Add From Palette, Swing Windows, File Chooser, and it appears in the inspector.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Right-click to change the variable name to fileChooser. Okay, now we can add our code, so double-click the

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Open menu item, and let's paste this code into the method. NetBeans wants us to import the classes that were

19
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
added in this code, so click OK. This code creates the fileChooser, reads whichever file you select,

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and places it into the text area. One more thing before we try it.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Go back to the Design mode, select the fileChooser, right-click, and select Properties.

22
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's add a title to dialogTitle. Let's call it Open Dialog. You can change the initial directory it points

23
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to with the currentDirectory property. I want to change mine to C drive.

24
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can also see that this option allows OPEN_DIALOG, SAVE_DIALOG, and custom options as well.

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's leave it as the OPEN_DIALOG for now. Okay, let's close this and run it. (Running)

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now go to the File menu and select Open. The fileChooser is created, pointing to the C drive as I wanted.

27
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We can now open any sort of file here within reason. Of course not everything is going to look beautiful in

28
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:26,000
our text area. So let's make a change that filters only .txt files.

29
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Exit the application, and select Source view. Just below the import statements here, we'll paste this code in.

30
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You don't have to fully understand this code to use it, but this creates an inner class that limits the file

31
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:02,000
type to .txt files. I called this class CustomFilter. Now return to Design mode, select the fileChooser,

32
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
right-click, select Properties, then click here next to the fileFilter property, then select custom code

33
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and type new CustomFilter. And that should do it. Now let's run it again. (Running)

34
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Click File and Open. Now the fileChooser limits the file types to .txt files.

35
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Obviously you could expand this and create a save dialog for your application as well.

36
00:06:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Next, we'll look at color choosers.
