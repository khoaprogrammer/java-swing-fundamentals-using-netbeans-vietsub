Swing menus allow checkboxes and radio buttons as menu items. In fact, all menu items extend a class called

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
abstract button as menus do behave much the same way as buttons do, if you think about it.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's add a new menu. Now I'll attempt its location over to the left of Help.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oops, I missed. Let me try again. Okay, let's call this menu CheckBox, then Add From Palette, Menu Item/CheckBox.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's add several. I'm not going to bother naming these. Let's add another menu and call it Radio.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to move this one over too. I'm getting better at this. Let's Add From Palette, Menu Item/RadioButton.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Again, let's add several. (Working) Now, radio buttons usually only allow one selection, so we'll need to add

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a radio button group. As expected, the group is invisible, but shows up in the inspector.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's select all three RadioButton items and select our buttonGroup.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's time to run it and try it out. Our CheckBox items can be selected or deselected, and our RadioButton

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
items behave as a group allowing only one to be selected at a time.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now, let's move forward and add real event code to our examples.
