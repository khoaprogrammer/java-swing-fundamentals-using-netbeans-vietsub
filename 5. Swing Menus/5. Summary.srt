00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now you have mastered the basics of Swing menus. You've learned how to place a menu and add multiple menu items

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with icon images and keyboard shortcuts as well. You also learned how to add checkboxes and radio

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
buttons to a menu and make use of radio button groups. You also learned how to build submenus within a menu.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You learned how to build pop-up menus as well.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You coded event handling code to exit an application, code to reopen an internal frame onto a desktop,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and you also learned about code to link multiple GUI interfaces together.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Lastly, you learned about the event methods mousePressed and mouseReleased and code to enable pop-up menus.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think you'll agree what you have just learned about Swing menus is powerful knowledge, yet it is quite

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:59:00,000
simple to implement.
