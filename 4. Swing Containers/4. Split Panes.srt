00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The next container we'll explore is the Split Pane. You have probably seen split panes used before

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
in applications. A split pane has two distinct resizable sections split either horizontally or vertically.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Example uses might be two text files that need to be compared or possibly a representation of a file structure.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can place anything in either side of the pane, possibly buttons in one pane and a result in the other.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I have created a new project with a class called PlaygroundGUI so we can explore.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's drag a split pane into the design area and have a look. Now this requires some explanation.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The split pane in NetBeans defaults to two buttons, but they don't show up as components, a little confusing.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The buttons are only placeholders and will disappear once we drag a JPanel into each side.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then we can add any components we wish. I want to add text areas to each pane.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I could try to drag text areas into each pane of the split pane and try to align the edges, but there is an easier way.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If I first drag two text areas into the design, (Working) then I can select them both, right-click, Enclose In,

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Split Pane, and that's a lot easier. Notice NetBeans also encloses these in scroll panes automatically.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's set each text area to lineWrap and wrapStyleWord and place some default text as well. (Working)

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's run it. The user can drag the divider back and forth as necessary.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can set the initial location of the divider with the dividerLocation property.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The default position is designated as -1, but if you want to move it elsewhere the number value is actually in pixels.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:03:06,000
(Working) You can also change the dividerSize property. That's also in pixels. (Working)

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You can of course set the divider to VERTICAL_SPLIT here in the orientation property as well. (Working)

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
An additional feature can be enabled with the oneTouchExpandable property.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
When enabled, two small arrows appear within the divider. (Working)

21
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Clicking on one expands to the maximum. Clicking the other returns to default and then maximum the other way.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's JSplit panes. You've learned the basic features. Please explore more with other components as well.
