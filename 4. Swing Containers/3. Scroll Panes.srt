Okay, let's explore scroll panes. Scroll panes are somewhat self-explanatory.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As you have seen, NetBeans intuitively encloses components in scroll panes, such as text areas, lists, and so on.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can also add scroll panes manually in much the same way as we did with JPanels or use the function,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Enclose In Scroll Pane, although some components are not allowed to be directly enclosed in a scroll pane.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You can though place components on a JPanel first and then enclose the JPanel in a scroll pane.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can then decide how to set the appearance of both the vertical and horizontal scroll bars using the

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
properties horizontalScrollBarPolicy and verticalScrollBarPolicy.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can choose AS_NEEDED, and they will appear when necessary. Or you can choose ALWAYS, and they will

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
always be visible. You can actually choose NEVER, but I'm not quite sure why you would add a scroll pane and

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
never have the scroll bars appear. Maybe you can tell me why. Another odd thing I haven't figured out,

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
there is a Scroll Bar component over here, but I don't know what you would ever do with it.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Please enlighten me if you have figured it out. (Working) Let's run the application and see how the scroll panel appears. (Working)
