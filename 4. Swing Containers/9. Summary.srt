1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You have learned about the structure and use of Swing containers and how NetBeans makes them easy to design and implement.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You've learned about JRootPane and its elements JLayeredPane containing JMenuBar and contentPane.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You've also learned about the six different layers that JLayeredPane consists of.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You learned to use JPanels to enclose and group other components into sections within your application.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You learned that you can enclose other containers inside a scroll pane.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You learned how to

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
implement split panes and its properties dividerLocation, dividerSize, and oneTouchExpandable.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You have learned how to create tabs within a tabbed pane and how to next tabbed panes as well.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You've learned the capabilities of JLayeredPane and how to hide or show a layer using the setVisible method.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You now know how to create floatable toolbars within any application.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You've learned how to build a fully-functioning desktop-style application using JDesktopPane and JInternalFrames.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You know how to make JInternalFrames iconifiable, maximizable, resizable, and closable.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Since now you have a good understanding of components and containers, you are already well

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:59:00,000
on your way to mastering Swing and NetBeans.
