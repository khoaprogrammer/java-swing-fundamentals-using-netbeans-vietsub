00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To understand Swing, you need to gain a basic understanding of containers.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Containers in Swing are used to group components together. Each container can set a different sort of layout

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
manager for its component. Containers include

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
JFrame, JWindow, JDialog, JPanel, JInternalFrame, and JApplet. Applets are programs designed to be viewed

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
within a web browser. We will not spend time with them, and instead focus on other containers.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The containers JFrame, JWindow, JDialog, and JInternalFrame all contain an instance of a class called JRootPane.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
JRootPane is a container that also contains a component called JLayeredPane, which includes the components

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
JMenuBar and a contentPane. JLayeredPane consists of these layers,

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
allowing components to be overlapped. At the bottom is the Frame_Content_Layer, which contains the JMenuBar

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and the contentPane. Next, is the Default_Layer where most components are added.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then the Palette_Layer where floating toolbars or palettes can be added.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Next, the Modal_Layer or Modal pop-up windows; then the PopUp_Layer for pop-ups and tooltips.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lastly, the Drag_Layer for objects dragged from outside the application.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're only covering the basics of containers here, but it will give you the concepts necessary to understand

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
what we are going to explore. Let's move on and look at each of the containers.
