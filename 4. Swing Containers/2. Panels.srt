00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first containers we are going to look at are also the simplest, JPanels.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
JPanel actually extends component, so it uses all the common properties of components we have already explored.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
To demonstrate, let's use our SwingComponentProject. Now of course I can drag a new JPanel onto the design

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:38,000
area, but since all my components are already present, I can select each set of components I choose to enclose

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in a JPanel, right-click, and choose Enclose In Panel. As I mentioned, panels have all the common properties

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of other components, such as background and foreground colors, borders, etc.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Mostly JPanels are useful for dividing sections of your application making the design cleaner and more

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
intuitive for the user. We haven't discussed layouts specifically, but here's a property for applying specific

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
layouts to each panel. Please explore layouts further if you wish.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now the most common and useful property of a panel is the border property.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's select Border and then Titled Border and add a title called Personal Info and change the font to Arial,

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bold, 12, and the border type to Etched. (Working) Let's run the application and see what it looks like.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think you'll agree that panels can clean up the look of your application dramatically.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now to clean up this further, I might like to lose the Bio label here and instead enclose the text area in a

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Titled Border JPanel and title it Bio. So Enclose In Panel, resize the panel, resize the text area a bit.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll change the Panel property to Titled Border, add the title Bio, change the font, and make sure it's the Etched Border.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I might also enclose these radio buttons as well and call them Marital Status.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So again Enclose In Panel, resize the panel, change the border to Titled Border once again, add the title

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Marital Status, change the font, and again make sure it's the Etched Border.

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now, let's run it and see what it looks like. (Running) Please feel free to play around and design your own version.
