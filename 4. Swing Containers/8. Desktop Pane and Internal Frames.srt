00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The last containers we're going to learn about are the coolest, I think, Desktop Pane and Internal Frames.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
These containers give you the power to build applications that look just like a computer desktop with internal windows.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The best way to teach you about these is just to show you. I've already built a new project called

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
DesktopProject with a class called DesktopGUI. Let's drag a Desktop Pane into the design area and stretch it

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to the maximum. You can change the background color to whatever you like.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now let's drag an Internal Frame on to the desktop. Not sure why the windows are so tiny by default.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The most important properties of internal frames are iconifiable, maximizable, and resizable.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We'll want to select all of these, and you'll see why in a minute.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And let's give the window a title as well. Let's add a couple more internal frames and duplicate those same

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:36,000
settings once again. (Working) Of course each internal frame can contain any containers or components.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's just add a label to each for now. It's time to run it and see what it does.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Check out the cool desktop. Since the internal frames are iconifiable, the minimize button appears in each frame.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And since the maximizable property is set, those buttons appear as well.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's also a menu on the left with the same options, so I'm able to minimize each frame, and they dock

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:30,000
along the bottom. I can also move the iconified frame, and it will now dock to the new location. (Working)

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Whichever frame you select automatically rises to the topmost layer so the frames can overlap.

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's one more property I should mention, and that's the closable property.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's select it for the first frame. Now you can see there is an X button allowing that window to close.

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Of course you would have to offer an option to find that window once again, possibly a menu, but we'll get to

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that soon enough. So now you've learned how to use Desktop Panes along with Internal Frames.
