Now let's explore layered panes. Now you might remember our discussion earlier about the various layers of

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the Root Pane. Layered panes take advantage of these so that layers of components can be painted on top of

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
each other and easily set to either visible or not visible.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's drag a layered pane into the design area. (Working) We'll need to add panels to the pane allowing the

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
addition of components as well if you wish. For this example though, let's just color each panel so we can

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
see what's going on. The first panel I drag is going to be in the topmost layer.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The next will be under that, and the next under that and so on. (Working)

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now to make a useful example, we'll need to write a small bit of code.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It will make more sense if we name each panel first. (Working)

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So let's control the visibility of the panels with buttons. I need to add four buttons, one for each panel. (Working)

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't need to waste time naming these buttons for now. Let's use the first button to make the red panel

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
visible and the others invisible, so we use the actionPerformed method to control this.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can type in redPanel.setVisible and set it to true, and I'll set the others to false. (Typing)

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now I can copy and paste this to save time. (Working) Here we'll make only the blue panel visible, (Working)

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:06,000
here we'll make the green visible, (Working) and here the yellow one visible. (Working)

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now let's try it. (Working) You've learned the basics of layered panes.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Do you have any idea about how you might use them?
