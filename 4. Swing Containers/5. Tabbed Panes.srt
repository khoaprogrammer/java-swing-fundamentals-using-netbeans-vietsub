Let's learn about tabbed panes next. Let's drag a Tabbed Pane into the design area.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we want to see defined edges around the pane, we'll need a border.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I like the Soft Bevel Border for this. Now the tabbed pane all by itself doesn't look like much.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To add tabs, you must drag JPanels into the tabbed pane for each tab.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When the border of the tabbed pane changes to dashed lines, then you can drop the panel in.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can of course place any sort of components into each tab. Let's add some labels to each just for

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
demonstration purposes. It is also possible to nest tabbed panes.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Select the tabbed pane, right-click, and select Enclose In Tabbed Pane.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That will add a tab. To add another tab, right-click, Add From Palette, Swing Containers, Tabbed Pane.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now to change the name of a tab, right-click, and go to Edit Text.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can use the tabPlacement property to position the tabs TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, or RIGHT.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can also order the tabs using the selectedIndex property. The index counts from 0, so the first tab is

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:05,000
numbered 0, the next 1, and so on, 0 being the default. Let's have a look at the application. (Working)

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oops, I forgot to add a border to the outer tabbed panes. Let's try again. (Working)

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You have learned the basics of tabbed panes now. I think you'll agree they're rather easy to implement.
