00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now that you have learned how to use NetBeans to generate Swing code for you, it would also be a very valuable

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
skill to learn how to actually hand code Swing yourself.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're in luck because there is another course here on Pluralsight that teaches exactly that.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I hope you have taken some time along the way to have a

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
look at the generated code and familiarized yourself with it.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now there are a few areas of Swing that I did not cover, number one being layouts since NetBeans takes care

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of most of that for you, but if you learn to code Swing, you will definitely need to spend time learning

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
about the various layouts Swing offers and how to use them. Other areas you may want to explore further

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
include Swing's Undo Management classes, Accessibility classes, or assistive technologies, Print Utilities,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and 2D and 3D drawing features. There are even add-ons for advanced charting and audio as well.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well I hope you've enjoyed the course and have learned some valuable information.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Until next time.
