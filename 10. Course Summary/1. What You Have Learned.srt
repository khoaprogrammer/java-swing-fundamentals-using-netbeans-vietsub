1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wow, we have covered quite a lot of information. You should now be capable of building nearly any sort of

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
GUI interface using Swing. You now have learned valuable skills that can

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
surely increase your worth as a programmer whether you are a beginner or a seasoned developer.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You learned about Swing's structure and capabilities.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You learned about the Model-View-Controller architecture and its benefits.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You learned how to download and use the NetBeans IDE and about many of its powerful features.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Most importantly, you have learned how the NetBeans IDE can make building complex cross-platform GUI

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
interfaces easy and fast, leaving time for more difficult coding that you will surely need.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You learned the basics of many Swing components including labels, text fields, text areas, buttons,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:11,000
radio buttons, checkboxes, lists, combo boxes, spinners, sliders, progress bars, tables, and trees.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You learned about Swing containers including panels, scroll panes, split panes, tabbed panes, layered panes,

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
toolbars, desktop panes, and internal frames. You learned how to

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
build Swing menus including checkbox menus, radio button menus, submenus, and pop-up menus and how to handle

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
events from menu selections. You learned how

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to create dialogs including the showMessageDialog,

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the showInputDialog,

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and the showOptionDialog. You learned how to

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
use File Choosers

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and Color Choosers as well. You learned about NetBeans powerful tool,

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the GridBag Customizer and how easy it is to build complex GUIs with it.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You learned how to bind properties of a component to another components property.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then you learned how to set up the Java DB database,

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
create tables,

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and data within it using NetBeans database tools.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You learned how to bind the database table to a JTable to display it.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Finally, you learned how to build

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
a complete application interacting with a database inserting, update, and deleting records.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You also had an introduction to the Java Persistence API.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You now have quite a lot of valuable tools and an idea about what else you might be able to learn to expand

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
upon those skills. You may have been wondering how to deploy your application once you've built it within NetBeans.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's pretty easy to do if you just right-click your project and select Clean and Build.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the directory structure of where your NetBeans projects are saved, there's a folder called dist for

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
distribution, and in that folder you will find a double-clickable, executable JAR file that you can distribute

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to run your application.
