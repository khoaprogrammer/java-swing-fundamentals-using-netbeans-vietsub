Hi. This is Rusty Lowery from Pluralsight. Welcome to Java Swing Development Using NetBeans.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this course, you're going to learn how to use NetBeans Integrated Development Environment or IDE to

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
program desktop applications using Java Swing. I think you'll find this process is rather easy to learn,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
yet the skills and concepts you will acquire are quite powerful and will increase your skillset as a

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
programmer in a big way.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I used to program Swing applications manually, but I was blown away when I discovered how easy NetBeans makes

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
this process in comparison. I assume that you have some familiarity with some sort of programming language,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but most of what we'll be doing here will not require an in-depth understanding of Java, although this

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
course can also benefit a seasoned programmer.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You will learn how to use the powerful NetBeans GUI builder to quickly develop complex user interfaces with

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
little effort allowing you more time to build the application logic instead.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
First, we'll start with a short introduction to Swing's architecture and features.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then we'll move on to explore NetBeans and its fantastic GUI builder.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We'll then jump right in and create a fully-functional application to give you a very good idea of just what

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
NetBeans and Swing can accomplish in a very short period of time.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then we'll dig deeper into each of Swing's components, containers, menus, and windows and explore what they offer.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Following that, we'll explore a NetBeans tool called GridBag Customizer that is very cool.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It makes the job of customizing your layouts and components very easy, and I think you will begin to really

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
understand the power NetBeans tools can offer. Lastly, we will move into some more advanced topics,

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
such as setting up a database to interact with an application and binding data to table views.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
NetBeans makes it easy to interface with any sort of database. Our focus will remain mainly on the Swing GUI

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
view, so I'll be providing the database code. This course is a great

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
entry point into the world of Java Swing. If you wish to continue your journey further, then you are in luck

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because there are more advanced courses covering Swing right here on Pluralsight.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now let's get started.
