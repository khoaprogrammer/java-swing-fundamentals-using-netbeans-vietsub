00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now let's take a look at Swing's popular features.  One of the most popular features of Swing is a

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
pluggable look and feel. Programmers can easily set the overall look and feel of an application so that it

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
matches the environment it will run on. Windows and components can have the look and feel that match

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
existing Windows, Mac, or Unix platforms. Swing also comes with very nice look and feel called metal,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which has some very nice features. Look and feel can also be switched by the user if you wish to allow that

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
without even closing the application since look and feels are dictated at runtime.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If it's important to you, the look and feel of each component can be customized to create any look and feel you wish.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Additional features of Swing include the ability to display tooltips and also bind keyboard commands to components.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's take a look at the SwingSet demo we downloaded earlier to demonstrate.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Start up the SwingSet application, let's click on the JTable for a typical-looking window, and click on View,

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and pull down to Look and Feel. You're currently viewing the Nimbus look and feel.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's switch it to the Motif Unix-style look, and then let's have a look at the Windows look.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, scroll down here to the bottom, and click on ToolTips, and as you roll over this image here you'll see

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the basic tooltip I'm sure you're already familiar with seeing.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But now roll over here, and you can see that Swing allows functionality for HTML-styled tooltips as well.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Play around some more here if you wish, and then let's get back to the course.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Another important feature of Swing is that all of its components are lightweight.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Essentially, this means that components are not dependent on the native OS and instead are created at runtime.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That means that Swing will run on Windows, Mac, Unix, Solaris, or any other machine that runs Java.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Lastly, let's talk just for a few minutes about the architecture that Swing is built on top of, and then we'll

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:59:00,000
move on to create some applications.
