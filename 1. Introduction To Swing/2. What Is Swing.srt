00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Before we get started writing our first application, let's talk for a moment about just exactly what Swing is.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In short, Swing is a powerful, customizable set of graphical components used to create Java desktop applications.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a GUI toolkit containing a wide array of graphical components that are independent of the underlying

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
operating system because they are created at runtime. Now I think the best way to demonstrate Swing's

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
capabilities is to check out an actual application. Let me show you a great example application provided on

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the Java website.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Open up a browser, go to Google, and search for java swingset download.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Click on the first item in the list, SwingSet3.jnlp. By the way, I'm sort of skipping ahead here.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This demo application requires that you have at least the Java Runtime Environment installed on your system

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or it won't run. If you don't have it installed, you can first search Google for just java download and then

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Download Free Java Software and install it. Now I'm assuming that you already have Java installed.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We're interested in SwingSet3.jnlp, so click the link, and the application will download to your computer.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We'll quit the browser, we'll go over here and double-click on SwingSet3.jnlp, and the application will run.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Please take some time to explore this application for a few minutes on your own.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can have a look at various types of containers and components Swing offers.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can even view the source code down here if you wish.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's talk briefly about a history of Swing. Swing is one of five libraries included in the Java Foundation

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Classes or JFC, along with the Abstract Windows Toolkit or AWT, the Accessibility API, the 2D API,

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the enhanced support for Drag and Drop functionality. The AWT was Java's first solution for functionality

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
necessary to operate a windowed application. AWT still is at the core of Swing, which was built on top of

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
AWT, enhancing it dramatically. The accessibility API provides an interface of your application's components

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to assisted technology, such as audible text readers or brail keyboards.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The 2D API contains classes used for painting shapes, fonts, or colors on a 2D surface.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Drag and drop allows users to transfer elements between Java applications and native applications.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But we're going to focus solely on the Swing elements of the JFC, but you may need to be aware of these

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
related APIs and how they interface with Swing. Next, we'll take a

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
look at some of Swing's popular features.
