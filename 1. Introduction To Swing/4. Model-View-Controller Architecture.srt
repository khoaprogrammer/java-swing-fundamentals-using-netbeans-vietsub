00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Swing uses a common architecture called MVC or Model-View-Controller architecture.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Exactly what is that? Well, model is a representative of the state of a component such as a scroll bar would

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
contain information about its current position, its width, its minimum and maximum values.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This information does not change if the way the component is represented on the screen changes.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The view is how the component looks on the screen. A window might appear on a Mac or a Windows machine with

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a different look and feel even though it's the same component. The controller tells the component how to

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
interact with events. Events could be a mouse-click, a keyboard command, or gaining or losing focus.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The controller decides how each component will or won't react to an event.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The model, the view, and the controller all act independently, yet they work together seamlessly.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Using the scroll bar as an example, the model provides the information about the scroll bar's width and the

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
position of the thumb. The view decides how to draw the scroll bar given that info, also knowing whether

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
it's horizontal or vertical and how to shade it. The controller knows that dragging the thumb or clicking

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the end arrows should trigger events. Separation in the Model-View-Controller design allows you to bind

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
multiple views to the same components. It allows data to be represented say by a table or a pie chart

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
without affecting the underlying model.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now that you have a good understanding of what Swing is, let's move forward to the next module and explore

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the GUI builder in NetBeans, and we'll build our first application.
