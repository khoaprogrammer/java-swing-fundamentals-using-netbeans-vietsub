NetBeans offers a powerful tool called the Beans Binding Library that is capable of binding values either

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
between different components or between a component and a database.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
These values are automatically kept in sync, all requiring only a few lines of code.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's start with a simple example that binds the properties of two components.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
One of the components will be the source, and the other will be the target.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A good example might be a JSlider providing its value to be displayed in a JLabel.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So I've built a new project called BindProject with a class BindGUI containing a JSlider and a JLabel,

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which I have left with the default names jSlider1 and jLabel1. Let's make the label's font bigger and bold.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To bind these, all we have to do is right-click the label, select Bind and the target property we would like to change.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's choose its text property. The binding source, of course, will be jSlider1, and the value we would expect

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the slider to output is an integer, so we select the value int.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As you see, the label's text has already changed to 0, which is the initial value of the slider.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's all there is to it. Now let's run it, and you see that the label's text is in sync with the output

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
value of the slider.
