3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You learned to bind the property of a

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
configure a Java DB Database in the NetBeans Services window. You learned how to start the database server,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
create a database,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000

You learned how to create an entity bean to represent data in the database table.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You've learned the basics of a very powerful tool that makes interacting with a database quite easy.
